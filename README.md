The project is about baby names survey across a country ; including no. of births per year , how the popularity has changed for a particular name per year, displaying names in different categories -male,female and both(male & female),and listing them as top 10, 20..etc.
I have used NETBEANS as a tool and java(jsp) as the language.The project includes Morris graph for displaying changes in popularity in graphical form. I have imported the database using SQL developer.
